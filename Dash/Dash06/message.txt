Hands tied
For each coalition, 42N will be awarded in points. N is the ratio between the number of piscine bracelets on the photo submitted. Only people with bracelets from the same coalition are accepted in the same photo. Only the photo with the most people will be accepted for each coalition. Any breach of the rules or attempt to cheat will of course be penalized by negative points for the whole coalition! Photo to be sent to the coalition channel on Discord. P.S.: Faces AND wristbands (still attached to the wrist and not broken) AND logins must be present on the photo...
